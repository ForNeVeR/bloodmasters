Bloodmasters launch arguments
=====================================================================

The Bloodmasters executable (bloodmasters.exe) is the actual game.
This executable only listens to 1 argument on the command line which
is the filename in which it will look for its startup information.

Example:  bloodmasters.exe launchargs.cfg

In this example, Bloodmasters will look for the file launchargs.cfg
in its own directory. In this file you can put settings that override
the original configuration (bloodmaster.cfg) and add settings which
tell the game how to start.

These are settings to tell the game how to start:

join = "217.67.231.10:6969";
This will start a client to join the server at the specified ip:port.

host = "bmserver.cfg";
This will start a server AND a client. This server will be hosting
the game configured in the server settings file bmserver.cfg. The
client will connecto to localhost once the server is started.

dedicated = "bmserver.cfg";
This will start a dedicated server hosting the game configured in
the server settings file bmserver.cfg.

For an example of a server settings configuration, use the
Bloodmasters launcher to export server settings to a CFG file.

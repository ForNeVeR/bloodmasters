=====================================================================

To query a server, send a UDP packet containing the following data:

unsigned short (2 bytes):  Length of the packet (7 in this case)
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Message code (13 in this case)
signed integer (4 bytes):  Anything you like

The last 4 bytes can be any integer you like. This integer will be
returned to you when you receive your answer. A launcher can use this
to store the current time and determine the ping to the server
without having to send a seperate ICMP ping.

=====================================================================

When successfull, the server will answer with the following UDP data:

unsigned short (2 bytes):  Length of the packet
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Message code (13 in this case)
signed integer (4 bytes):  Whatever you sent in the request
unsigned byte (1 bytes):   Length of server title
string (# bytes):          Server title
boolean (1 byte):          True when locked with a password
unsigned byte (1 bytes):   Length of website URL
string (# bytes):          Website URL
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Maximum clients
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Maximum players
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Game type (see below)
unsigned byte (1 bytes):   Length of short map name
string (# bytes):          Short map name
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Current number of clients
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Current number of players
unsigned byte (1 byte):    Protocol version

The structures that follow may change with protocol versions,
so make sure the protocol version you read matches the
protocol version you expected to ensure you will read the
following structures correctly!

The following structures apply to protocol version 27 and higher.

signed short (2 bytes):    Score limit
signed short (2 bytes):    Time limit

    boolean (1 byte):          True when player is a spectator
    signed short (2 bytes):    Player ping

The following structures apply to protocol version 28 and higher.

unsigned byte (1 bytes):   Length of build description

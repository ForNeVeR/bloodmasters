Mapping for Bloodmasters using Doom Builder
-------------------------------------------


- Copy Bloodmasters.cfg and XenNode.exe to your Doom Builder folder.
It doesn't matter where you keep the file Bloodmasters.wad.



- Use Bloodmasters.wad as the IWAD for the Bloodmasters configuration.



- You MUST use XenNode as nodebuilder. Any other nodebuilder may
appear to build the map correctly at first, but it will not be
optimized and cause a major performance loss!

XenNode parameters:   %F -o %F



- You MUST make a configuration lump in the map. When you load/create
your map using the Bloodmasters configuration file in Doom Builder,
go to the Scripts menu -> Edit CONFIG Lump. The game types shown
in the sample below are required for the launcher to show the map
in its list for the correct game modes.

Sample configuration:

title = "Lava Ruins";
author = "Pascal vd Heiden";
players = 12;
ceilinglight = 0.188f;

sound1 = "amblava.wav";
sound2 = "ambpower.wav";

dm = true;
tdm = true;
ctf = false;
sc = false;
tsc = false;
st = false;
tst = false;



- Mark lines which are always blocking the light as "Solid Wall"!
This helps the nodebuilder optimizing the map.



- The 3D Mode Start thing is also the position at which a player in
the game will start spectating after loading the map!



- Do not have void areas in the middle of your map. Essentially, your
map should be inside one big square sector.



- It is recommended to make a new .zip directory for your map and put
your map and textures in there.


- Testing through Doom Builder (F5) is not possible. You must save
your map and launch the game with the normal launcher to test it.

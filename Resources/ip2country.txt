GET THE LATEST IP 2 COUNTRY FILE HERE:
http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/node/view/5


The CSV file contains five fields: 
- Begining of IP address range 
- Ending of IP address range 
- Two-character country code based on ISO 3166 
- Three-character country code based on ISO 3166 
- Country name based on ISO 3166 

This is a sample of how the CSV file is structured: 
"0033996344","0033996351","GB","GBR","UNITED KINGDOM"
"0050331648","0083886079","US","USA","UNITED STATES"
"0094585424","0094585439","SE","SWE","SWEDEN"
...

Note: All IP addresses are represented as IP Numbers which is the numeric representation of the dotted IP address.


You can import this data into any database by creating a table with the following fields:

FIELD DATA TYPE FIELD DESCRIPTION 
IP_FROM NUMERICAL (DOUBLE) Beginning of IP address range. 
IP_TO NUMERICAL (DOUBLE) Ending of IP address range. 
COUNTRY_CODE2 CHAR(2) Two-character country code based on ISO 3166. 
COUNTRY_CODE3 CHAR(3) Three-character country code based on ISO 3166. 
COUNTRY_NAME VARCHAR(50) Country name based on ISO 3166 

You can query the above table, after you have imported the data into it, to find the country of a corresponding IP Number by issuing the following Select statement: 
SELECT COUNTRY_NAME FROM <TableName> WHERE IP_FROM <= IP Number and IP_TO >= IP Number


The IP_FROM and IP_TO fields of the IP-to-Country Database are numeric representations of the dotted IP address. The formula to convert an IP Address of the form A.B.C.D to an IP Number is:

IP Number = A x (256*256*256) + B x (256*256) + C x 256 + D

Which is the same as:

IP Number = A x 16777216 + B x 65536 + C x 256 + D


In PHP 4 you can use the following to convert a dotted IP Address to its corresponding IP Number:

$ip_number = sprintf("%u", ip2long($dotted_ip_address));

and this to convert IP Number to its corresponding dotted IP Address:

$dotted_ip_address = long2ip($ip_number);
